Through early men and women did not leave written records, they did leave tools, bones, and pictures. Stone Age hand axes and hatchets were made from stones that were carefully chipped away to form sharp cutting edges. In some the pattern of chipping shows that these tools and weapons were made by right handed people designed to fit comfortable into a right hand. Other Stone Age implements were made by or for left handers prehistoric pictures painted on the walls of caves provide further clues to the handedness of ancient people. A right hander finds it easier to draw faces of people and animals facing toward the left whereas, a left hander finds it easier to draw faces facing toward the right. Both kinds of faces have been found in ancient painting. On the whole the evidence seems to indicate the prehistoric people were either ambidextrous or about equally likely to be left or right handed. But in the Bronze Age, the picture changed. the tools and weapons found from that period are mostly made for right handed use. The predominance of right handedness among humans today had apparently already been established.\n\nWhat is the indirect evidence through which the preferred handedness of the Stone Age people could be understood?",

The main consumers of white cement are therefore, cement title and cement paint manufacturing units.

The present annual licensed production capacity of white and grey cement in a country is approximately 3.5 lakh tones. The average demand of 2-2.5 lakh tones. This means that there is idle capacity to the tune of the laksh tones or more. The price is therefore, not a phenomenon arising out of inadequate production capacity but evidently because of artificial scarcity created by the manufactures in their self interest. The main reason for the continuing spurt in cement price is its decontrol. As it is, there is stiff competition in the cement paint and tile manufacturing business. Any further price revision at this stage is bound to have a severe adverse impact on the market conditions. The Government should take adequate steps to ensure that suitable control are brought in.
